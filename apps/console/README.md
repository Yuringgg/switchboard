# apps/console

Next.js 15 (App Router) + Tailwind + shadcn/ui → **Vercel**.

Two things live here, and the boundary between them matters:

- **The console** — timeline, search, contacts, assistant. Talks to Supabase with
  the **anon key + user session**, so RLS applies and a user can only ever reach
  their own rows.
- **Ingest webhooks** — `app/api/webhooks/`. Serverless, per ADR-011, because a
  cold-starting container drops webhooks and providers eventually disable an
  endpoint that keeps timing out.

**Ingest does three things: verify the signature, insert a `raw_events` row,
return 200.** No parsing, no enrichment, no API calls. The temptation to "just do
a little normalization here" is exactly what the ingest/worker split exists to
prevent.

Scaffolded in Phase 0 (`docs/04-ROADMAP.md`) — currently a placeholder.
